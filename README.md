# What is Openstack ?

>  OpenStack is a free and open-source cloud-computing software platform.[2] Users primarily deploy it as an infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS). The technology consists of a group of interrelated projects that control pools of processing, storage, and networking resources throughout a data center—which users manage through a web-based dashboard, through command-line tools, or through a RESTful API..
